Here i have completed my assingment using html nd css the following tag used in this are:-
1) first we make a div for upper text i.e. free shipping for all order now. we kept it in h4 tag bcz it hav small size.
2) then we create a nav bar for that we use nav tag under that nav tag we write the men, women, kids etc this one and for search bar we use the input tag and give a attribute as text . anf for seach icon we kept it in soan tag.
3) next we see that we use tha main section for that we use the section tag and we make header and under the header tag we use to write the header content . basically we the h1 tag and p tag for the heading content .
4) next we make another div where our content that are in horizontal direction are kept this is done by flex hixh use in css property.
we make a div tag as c1_sub and under that div we make another  div for that we apply there a image of shoes as Air jorden 7, Air jorden 3, etc.
5) next we see that we have another div where we have to use the div tag as container.
6) and inside the div we give him a background color by using linear-gradient property.
7) and we usually write the para under the p tag.
8) and at last we use the img tag for to attach the shoe image that are hover while touching . and this hover propert is use in css .
  Lets move to css property :

1) firstly we use the selector as universal selector and there we usually giv margin and padding as 0 . and give border-sizing:border-box;.
2) then we give the color for the upper section that are in div as css property linear gradient, text-color, and padding.
3) then for the nav bar where we have mention men, women, kids etc there we give the property as text-align: center , background-color, color, padding .
4) then we usually give the sales div section a background color , image color, background-position, text-align.
5) If we want to give the perticular div where we have attache the image as css property the we use to apply property as height, width, display: inline-block , padding .
6) if we want to give full container width, height we give them.
7) if we want ot give shoes as to be hover while touching the we use psedu-class where we give the property as hover . ifwe want to applyproperty on shoe1 the we write as shoe1:hover and give property as position an relative , width, height, border, box-shadow.
